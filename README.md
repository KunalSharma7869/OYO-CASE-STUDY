This repository hosts the solutions for Oyo business room sales analysis.
I used various SQL functions such as :
✅ Case When Statements
✅ CTE
✅ Joins
✅ Logical Operator
✅ Group by, Order by, Where
✅ Aggregate functions Sum, Count, Average
✅ Date functions Datename, Datediff, Month

Database Used - Microsoft SQL Server
Insights:-

Banglore , gurgaon & delhi were popular in the bookings, whereas Kolkata is less popular in bookings
Nature of Bookings:
• Nearly 50 % of the bookings were made on the day of check in only.
• Nearly 85 % of the bookings were made with less than 4 days prior to the date of check in.
• Very few no.of bookings were made in advance(i.e over a 1 month or 2 months).
• Most of the bookings involved only a single room.
• Nearly 80% of the bookings involved a stay of 1 night only.

Oyo should acquire more hotels in the cities of Pune, Kolkata & Mumbai. Because their average room rates are comparetively higher so more revenue will come.

The % cancellation Rate is high on all 9 cities except pune , so Oyo should focus on finding reasons about cancellation.
